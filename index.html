    <H2 class="bold">Hello! My name is Adele and this is my website about my study abroad experience in Austria:</H2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    
    <p>This summer I studied abroad in Innsbruck, Austria, a beautiful city in the heart of the Alps. I was in Innsbruck taking classes and exploring for about six weeks, and I enjoyed every second. I took two classes, Alpine Geography and International Communications. But when we weren't in class we had plenty of opportunities to enjoy Europe. While I was in Innsbruck I stayed in the Home4Students, a dorm for people attending the University of Innsbruck. Below is a picture of the dorm building, with the mountains behind. I lived here with around two-hundred and fifty other students. The dorm was a ten-minute walk from the downtown area and five minutes from the school which was very convenient. I enjoyed living here over the summer because I was surrounded by my friends and close to the downtown area where we would go to eat, and if I was ever late for class it was just a quick walk away!!</p>

<p class=bold>Below is a list of places I visited each weekend, in order:</p>
<ol><li>Dacahu</li>
    <li>Berlin</li>
    <li>Vienna</li>
    <li>Budapest</li>
    <li>Munich, Achensee, and Bolzano</li>
</ol>  
<p>While I was staying in Innsbruck I had the opportunity to travel each weekend. The first weekend I was in Innsbruck I took two a field trip to Dachau to reflect on history. The next weekend my friends and I went to Berlin where we visited the Berlin wall and explored the nightlife. The next weekend we went to Vienna. In Vienna we went to Central Cafe and St. Stephens Cathedral. Next, we went to Budapest, which was my favorite place I visited. We stayed in a tiny apartment which was very close to a Cathedral. While there we visited the spas, which were essentially hot baths created by geothermal springs. That night we took a cruise on the Danube river to see the sunset. It was a beautiful to watch the city light up at night. In our final weekend we visited Bolzano, Italy and Munich, Germany as well as a lake called Acehnese. In Italy we had pizza, of course. Meanwhile, in Munich we explored local culture. Finally, we swam in Achensee, a beautiful, clear, blue alpine lake. I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to visit these places and make lifelong memories.</p>

<p class=bold>Final note:</p>
    
 <p>One of my favorite parts of Innsbruck was the mountains. The entire town was surrounded by the Alps. It was like living in a post card. At least once a day I was forced to confront their splendor, ask if they were indeed, real. Looking back, I have to ask myself that same question. Memory cannot fully capture that feeling, as I lay by the river, eyes-closed, relaxed, knowing when I opened my eyes I would be face to face with mountains formed millions upon millions of years ago, still standing in stark contrast to the timeless sky. There are a lot of things I miss about last summer, but the memories I do have are happy ones: laughing with friends, running to catch the train, waking up in a new country. So, I want to end this story with a picture. This is a bench in the Austrian Alps above Innsbruck. That mountain range I saw every day, I got to visit the top. After taking several gondolas and walking a short distance, I happened upon this bench. I only got to sit there for a short while, but maybe someday I can go back. In the meantime, I will try to remember how it felt. </p>
